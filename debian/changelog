superslicer (2.3.57.12-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Patch to ignore error returned by glewInit(). This thorny issue
    is discussed in Bug#1020640 and Bug#1020702. This patch *SEEMS*
    to work, but the issue will need a proper resolution. YMMV
  * Patch to fix wxGTK ampersand issue UnsavedChangesDialog. (& -> &amp;)
    patch to change '&' to '&amp;' for html markdown in the Unsaved Changes
    dialog. Items with an ampersand (e.g. 'Width & Flow') would be missing
    from the dialog box, causing problems.
  * Patch FindOpenVDB.cmake with updated file from prusa-slicer 2.5

  patches (refreshed) from prusa-slicer packaging:

  * Stop linking against cereal library as it doesn't exist. Fixes FTBFS.
  * Use packaged catch2 library. Thanks to Tobias Frost <tobi@debian.org>
  * Build-dep on catch2 and drop tests/catch2 files
  * Drop Move-Catch-namespace-into-PrusaCatch.patch.
    This is no longer needed now that we're using the packaged catch library
  * Disable compilation of test_voronoi.cpp to workaround FTBFS
  * Patch to fix wxTranslations::Get() nullptr segfault
  * Set OPENVDB_FIND_MODULE_PATH to use upstream FindOpenVDB.cmake
  * Change to build with wxWidgets 3.2, OpenVDB 9, libglew 2.2

superslicer (2.3.57.12-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * quick-fix-for-problematic-profiles.patch
    The stable version (this) SuperSlicer does not handle some new profile
    settings despite release notes to the contrary. We patch the troublesome
    profiles to keep the program from generating a segmentation fault.

superslicer (2.3.57.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * remove-FreeCAD-generator-feature.patch
    Remove the feature to generate objects via FreeCAD scripting. It is in
    a very, very early stage of development and seems not all that useful.

  * change-bgcolor-ConfigWizard-filament-note.patch
    Use the window background color instead of the menu background for the
    note area in the filament section of the configuration wizard. Avoids
    the issue of text being difficult to read if a theme uses a dark menu.

https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer
.SS "Actions:"
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-3mf\fR
Export the model(s) as 3MF.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-amf\fR
Export the model(s) as AMF.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-gcode\fR, \fB\-\-gcode\fR, \fB\-g\fR
Slice the model and export toolpaths as G\-code.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-obj\fR
Export the model(s) as OBJ.
.HP
\fB\-\-export\-sla\fR, \fB\-\-sla\fR Slice the model and export SLA printing layers as PNG.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-stl\fR
Export the model(s) as STL.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcodeviewer\fR
Visualize an already sliced and saved G\-code
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Show this help.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-fff\fR
Show the full list of print/G\-code configuration options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-sla\fR
Show the full list of SLA print configuration options.
.TP
\fB\-\-info\fR
Write information about the model to the console.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\fR ABCD
Save configuration to the specified file.
.TP
\fB\-\-slice\fR, \fB\-s\fR
Slice the model as FFF or SLA based on the printer_technology configuration
value.
.SS "Transform options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-align\-xy\fR X,Y
Align the model to the given point.
.TP
\fB\-\-center\fR X,Y
Center the print around the given center.
.TP
\fB\-\-cut\fR N
Cut model at the given Z.
.TP
\fB\-\-dont\-arrange\fR
Do not rearrange the given models before merging and keep their original XY
coordinates.
.TP
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR N
Multiply copies by this factor.
.TP
\fB\-\-duplicate\-grid\fR X,Y
Multiply copies by creating a grid.
.TP
\fB\-\-merge\fR, \fB\-m\fR
Arrange the supplied models in a plate and merge them in a single model in order
to perform actions once.
.TP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
Try to repair any non\-manifold meshes (this option is implicitly added whenever
we need to slice the model to perform the requested action).
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\fR N
Rotation angle around the Z axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\-x\fR N
Rotation angle around the X axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\-y\fR N
Rotation angle around the Y axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\fR N
Scaling factor or percentage.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\-to\-fit\fR X,Y,Z
Scale to fit the given volume.
.TP
\fB\-\-split\fR
Detect unconnected parts in the given model(s) and split them into separate
objects.
.SS "Other options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-config\-compatibility\fR
This version of Slic3r may not understand configurations produced by newest
Slic3r versions. For example, newer Slic3r may extend the list of supported
firmware flavors. One may decide to bail out or to substitute an unknown value
with a default silently or verbosely. (disable, enable, enable_silent; default:
enable)
.TP
\fB\-\-datadir\fR ABCD
Load and store settings at the given directory. This is useful for maintaining
different profiles or including configurations from a network storage.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-nonexistent\-config\fR
Do not fail if a file supplied to \fB\-\-load\fR does not exist.
.TP
\fB\-\-load\fR ABCD
Load configuration from the specified file. It can be used more than once to
load options from multiple files.
.TP
\fB\-\-loglevel\fR N
Sets logging sensitivity. 0:fatal, 1:error, 2:warning, 3:info, 4:debug, 5:trace
For example. loglevel=2 logs fatal, error and warning level messages.
.TP
\fB\-\-output\fR ABCD, \fB\-o\fR ABCD
The file where the output will be written (if not specified, it will be based on
the input file).
.TP
\fB\-\-single\-instance\fR
If enabled, the command line arguments are sent to an existing instance of GUI
Slic3r, or an existing Slic3r window is activated. Overrides the
"single_instance" configuration value from application preferences.
.SS "Print options are processed in the following order:"
.IP
1) Config keys from the command line, for example \fB\-\-fill\-pattern\fR=\fI\,stars\/\fR
.IP
(highest priority, overwrites everything below)
.IP
2) Config files loaded with \fB\-\-load\fR
3) Config values loaded from amf or 3mf files
.PP
